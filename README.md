TASK-3 : Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier

##Project Overview: This project focuses on building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service, using the Bank Marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains information related to direct marketing campaigns. Our goal is to predict the outcome (`y`) of the marketing campaign based on customer and campaign attributes.

## Dataset Used : Bank Marketing Dataset

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Read the CSV file using pandas
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split into features and target

2. **Model Building**
   - Train a `DecisionTreeClassifier`
   - Evaluate using a test set

3. **Visualization**
   - Plot the Decision Tree
   - Display confusion matrix and classification report

## Results
- Achieved classification metrics showing how well the model predicts customer purchase behavior.
- Visual representation of decision-making through decision tree classifier using plot tree. .

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
